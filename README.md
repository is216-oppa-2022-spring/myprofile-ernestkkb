# :wave: My Profile

## ðŸ¤“ Objective
The goal of "My Profile" assignment is to give every student an opportunity to build a beautiful, interactive, and responsive website on a weekly basis. This is a term-long assignment (Week 1 through Week 16), and it will count towards your **Class Participation**.

Each week, you need to **update README** and describe the new changes you've implemented. Create a **new section** for **each new week**. For example, see below:

## (Week 1) My First GitHub Commit & Push
Basic information and links along with a profile picture :)

## (Week 2 & 3) Styling
Added more information regarding myself + Bootstrap components: Card, Jumbotron, List Group and Nav
Will work on styling it more and adding dynamic components next week :)

## (Week 4 & 5) Adding of JavaScript
Used Javascript collapse components to allow users to toggle information
Will work on styling and work on adding more dynamic components next week :)

## (Week 11 & 12) Vue Js!
Converted application from vanilla javascript to one that is Vue.JS compliant
Created a few custom components and will work on making it prettier shortly!
